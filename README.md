# The Way We Work

**We don't have seniority levels** (like junior, mid-level, senior, etc.) in titles at Craftgate. We call ourselves as `crafters`. We love our profession and we believe that we are in a journey of craftsmanship. 

**We don't have any team leader position** at Craftgate. Every crafter is a natural-born leader and leads the team unintentionally regartless of work experience in years. 

**We are active practitioners of pair/mob programming**. Therefore all crafters are expected to be skilled at collaboration and teamwork.
